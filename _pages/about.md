I'm a postdoctoral fellow working with Drs. Sonya MacParland and Gary Bader at the University Health Network and the University of Toronto. I use genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data to explore immune-mediated diseases of the gut and liver. My work focuses on individual cell types and cellular systems, using computational biology to understand how their variation shapes disease mechanisms.
